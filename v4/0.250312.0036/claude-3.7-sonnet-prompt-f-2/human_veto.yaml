    The commentary on the plots is incorrect. For example:
    "Gradual adaptation with decreased firing frequency over time" - does not happen.
    "Initial high-frequency firing that gradually slows down (spike frequency adaptation)" - does not happen
    "Earlier recordings (e.g., recording #1) show more vigorous action potential firing" - does not happen.
    etc.
