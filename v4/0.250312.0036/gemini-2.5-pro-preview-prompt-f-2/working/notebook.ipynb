The effective voltage units (after conversion) appear to be in Volts, but the scale (e.g. -0.0022 V or -2.2 mV baseline for response) seems plausible for raw intracellular recordings, perhaps with offset.\n",
    "*   **Channel 1:** No stimulus current is recorded for `stimulus-01-ch-1`. However, `current_clamp-response-01-ch-1` shows a voltage change that mirrors the timing of the stimulus on channel 0. This could be due to various reasons such as electrical cross-talk between channels, a stimulus applied to both but only logged for channel 0 in the `stimulus` group, or a coupled physiological response. The conversion factor for channel 1 response is extremely small (e-13), so the y-axis values are very small but still show a clear shape. This is an interesting artifact or feature to note."

    "*   The stimulus descriptions often mention \"ramp\" but the visualized stimuli were square pulses.\n",
    "*   Channel 0 received explicit current injections (mostly hyperpolarizing in the examples shown).\n",

    "*   **Comprehensive Sweep Analysis:** Systematically iterate through all sweeps in this NWB file (and others in the Dandiset) to categorize stimulus types (e.g., depolarizing, hyperpolarizing, varying amplitudes/durations) and characterize responses (e.g., subthreshold, spiking, adaptation).\n",
    "*   **Quantitative Analysis:** Extract features from the responses, such as resting membrane potential, input resistance (from hyperpolarizing pulses), spike threshold, firing rate, action potential shape, etc.\n",
    "*   **Comparison across Conditions:** The Dandiset description mentions different experimental conditions (DCZ vs. DCZ + mCherry). Analyze and compare neuronal responses under these different conditions.\n",
    "*   **Explore Other NWB Files:** This Dandiset contains 50 assets. Analyzing other NWB files might reveal different types of responses or clearer examples of specific phenomena.\n",
